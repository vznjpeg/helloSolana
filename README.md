Three Key Solana Smart Contract Concepts

1. Programs

Solana smart contracts, called programs, are stateless, compiled to BPF bytecode, and deployed on-chain. They define logic executed by the Solana runtime, processing instructions from clients. Programs are immutable once deployed, ensuring consistent behavior.

2. Accounts

Accounts store data on Solana’s blockchain. Unlike Ethereum, Solana separates code (programs) from data (accounts). Each account has an owner (a program), and only that program can modify its data. Accounts hold user data, program state, or tokens.

3. Instruction Processing

Programs process instructions, which are client-submitted transactions specifying actions. Instructions include input data and target accounts. Solana’s runtime executes these in parallel (via Sealevel) for high throughput, leveraging program-defined logic to update account states.
